It seems like this rural village has finally settled down But now, some bear-like vagrant barges into our restaurant, spouting nonsense. "I've come to repay a debt I owe your father from the war." And yet, this guy doesn't even know what he supposedly owes. My father passed away during the war, so there's no way to ask him! I told him to just leave, but this vagrant says: "How much do you want? I'll pay whatever you ask." Do I look like I lack pride, even if I'm short on money? "Forget the money, pay it back with labor." "With my body, or someone else's? Either way, I can" "Just go chop some onions!" </p>

            <p>Why You Should <a href="https://www.mangakakalove.com/">Read Manga</a> Online at mangakakalove.com ?</p>
            <p>There are many reasons you should read Manga online, and if you are a fan of this unique storytelling
                style then learning about them is a must. One of the biggest reasons why you should read Manga online is
                the money it can save you. While there's nothing like actually holding a book in your hands, there's
                also no denying that the cost of those books can add up quickly. So why not join the digital age and
                read Manga online? Another big reason to read Manga online is the huge amount of material that is
                available. When you go to a comic store or other book store their shelves are limited by the space that
                they have. When you go to an online site to read Manga those limitations don't exist. So if you want the
                best selection and you also want to save money then reading Manga online should be an obvious choice for
                you</p>
